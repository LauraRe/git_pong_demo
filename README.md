## Learning Git Pong.

## Hi, LauraRe! thanks for inviting me.  

## Welcome Bitnoori! What do you think about Harry Potter? It looks like a pretty popular topic in the prep-course! 

## Oh, Harry Potter! it was really popular in Korea where I originally come from. I do prefer books to movies. How about you? 

## I actually enjoyed both! And it was pretty popular in Italy as well (my native land). Which is/was your favourite house (Hogwarts)?
